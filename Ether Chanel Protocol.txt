Ether Chanel Protocol Port Channel LAG(Link Aggregation Group)
this is a layer 2 protocol
difference between Access switch & Distribution switch 
1- Access switch : a switch that end hosts like PCs and Servers connect to
2- Distribution switch : a switch that access switches connect to 
What is a oversubscription
when the bandwidth of the interfaces connected to end hosts is greater than the bandwidth of the connection to a distribution switch(es) , some oversubscription is acceptable but too much will cause congestion
in the first figure we notice that there are a lot of end hosts connected to ASW1 and there is a single connection between ASW1 & DSW2.
the connection to DSW1 is congested it should add another link to increase the bandwidth so it can support all of the end hosts
even if the admin will add connections between ASW1 & DSW1 the problem will not be resolved and there will still be a congestion ; this is due to STP(Spanning Tree Protocol) 
that will block redundant ports and enable only one port so even if ASW1 & DSW1 are connected through multiple ports only one will be enabled and others are disabled . Here where we need ETHERCHANNEL .
EtherChannel is a layer 2 protocol that groups multiple interfaces together to act as a single interface and STP will treat this group as a single interface.

Note : TRaffic using the EtherChannel will be load balanced among the physical interfaces in the group . AN algorithm is used to determine which traffic will use which physical interface .

EtherChannel Load Balancing
EtherCHannel load balances based on "flows"
A flow is a communication between two nodes in the network.
frames in the same flow will be forwarded using the same physical interface
if frames in the same flow were forwarded using different physical interfaces some frames may arrive at the destination out of order which can cause problems . Some application can deal with frames that don't arrive in the appropriate order however other application can not.
In figure 2 let's assume that PC1 want to communicate with PR1 a calculation will be done to determine which physical interface among the ehterchannel groupe will be selcted to handle the traffic between these two nodes.
this calculation used different inputs that you can change and modify , the inputs are as the following :
-Source Mac
-Destination Mac
-Source/Destination Mac
-Source IP
-Destination IP
-Source/Destination IP

Load-Balancing COnfiguration
to see the current inputs used to do the selection calculation use the caomande 
ASW1#show etherchannel load-balance

to change the method of load balancing use the following command 
ASW1(config)#port-channel load-balance <method of load balancing>

to show the available load-balancing methods on a device use the follwoing command 
ASW1(config)#port-channel load-balance ?

EhterChannel Configurtion
There are three methods of EtherChannel configuration 
PAgP(Port Agregation Protocol)
cisco proprietary protocol
dynamically negotiates the creation/mainetanance of the etherchannel 

LACP (Link Aggregation Protocol)
Industry stadard protcol (IEEE 802.3ad)
dynamically negotiates the creation/mainetanance of the etherchannel 
Static Etherchannel
a protcol is not use to determine if an etherchannel should be formed
interfaces are statically configured to form ehterchannel

up to 8 interfaces can be formed into a single etherchannel (LACP allows up to 16 but only 8 will be active the other 8 will be i standby mode waiting for an active interface to fail)

PAgP Configuration
ASW1(config)#interface range g0/0 -3
ASW1(config-if-range)#channel-group 1 mode ? <use one of the follwing options>  
active 
auto
desirable
on 
passive 
Note :  the channel groupe number has to match in the same switch but it does not have to much the channel group channel number on the other siwtch

if you use auto / desirable the protocol used will be automatically PAgP
if you use active /passive the protocol  use will be automatically LACP
if you use on then you are using the Static configuration protocol

the auto and desirable are for PAgP and active and passive are used for LACP
auto will not acitvally tryto form an etherchannel 
desirble will activaly try to form an etherchannel
passive will not activaly try to form an ehterchannel
active will activaly try to form an ehterchannel

auto +  auto  = no ehterchannel
desirable + desirable  = ehterchannel
auto + desirbale  = etherchannel
active + active = ehterchannel
passive + passive  = no etherchannel
active + passsive  = ehterchannel
Note : on mode works only with on mode 

to determine which protocol you want to use to configure etherchannel use the follwoing command
ASW1(config)#interface range g0/0 -3
ASW1(config-if-range)#channel-protocol ? [lacp / pAgp]

after ehterchannel configuration you can configure the portchannel ; the portchannel will be listed with the rest of siwtch interfaces (it is listed the last one generally)
in the figure number 3 : the port channel is configured as a trunk switchport :
